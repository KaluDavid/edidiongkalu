      "Estate management in Nigeria has long depended on manual processes. Payments are collected through cash, bank transfers, and WhatsApp messages, leaving both residents and administrators struggling to stay organized. KoboSmart was designed to close this gap. It brings together bill payments, community management, and accountability into one digital platform.",
      "When I joined the project, my role was to lead the design for the entire product from concept to high-fidelity execution. I was responsible for shaping the resident experience, building admin tools, designing security interactions, and architecting the super admin web dashboard. The goal was to: design a unified platform that simplifies life for everyone in the estate ecosystem, residents, estate admins, security teams, and platform administrators.",

As the sole product designer, I shaped the experience from the ground up, conducting research, mapping user flows, and creating an interface that feels modern, trustworthy, and easy to navigate. Every design decision was guided by the goal, to help users feel more confident and in control of their finances.",

      "Managing finances as a student can be challenging, with limited income, academic expenses, and the temptation of impulse spending. Many students struggle to build healthy savings habits, plan for long-term goals, and manage debt effectively. This project focuses on developing a student-focused savings application that simplifies financial planning, promotes disciplined saving and provides tools to help students achieve financial security during and after their studies.",
      "The app is designed to empower students to save, budget, and manage debt, enabling them to build habits that lead to financial independence. It introduces innovative features such as goal-based savings, group savings, and a unique lock funds feature, allowing students to secure savings until after graduation, ensuring they have funds available for important life transitions.",
